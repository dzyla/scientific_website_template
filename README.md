# Scientific Website Template

This repository contains a minimal Hugo template for scientific labs. It includes:

* A custom theme `SciLab` with a 50% width layout.
* Menu items for Research, The Team, Publications, Resources, Lab Fun and Lab Philosophy.
* A shortcode for displaying news from `data/news.yaml`.

Build the site with:

```bash
hugo
```
