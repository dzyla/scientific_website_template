  <h1>Welcome to Bio Lab</h1>
  <p>Our lab is interested in molecular and biophysical aspects of host cell virus interactions. We use structural biology and biophysical techniques to study these interactions at the molecular level, including cryo-electron tomography and X-ray crystallography. Our research aims to uncover the mechanisms of viral entry and replication in host cells, providing insights for the development of antiviral strategies and provide snapshots of the dynamic processes involved.</p>
  <p>To start the infection, viruses need to first attach to the host cell surface and then enter the cell. This process involves a series of interactions between viral proteins and host cell receptors, which we study using advanced imaging techniques. Understanding these interactions is crucial for developing effective antiviral therapies.</p>
