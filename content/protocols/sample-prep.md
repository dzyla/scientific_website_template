### This protocol describes the steps for preparing cryo-EM samples.

1.  **Grow cells to mid-log phase.**
    - Culture cells in appropriate media to a density of 1-2 x 10^6 cells/mL.
2.  **Harvest and wash with buffer.**
    - Centrifuge cells and resuspend in a suitable buffer (e.g., PBS or Tris-HCl).
3.  **Apply sample to grids and plunge freeze.**
    - Apply 3-4 ÂµL of the sample to a glow-discharged cryo-EM grid.
    - Blot away excess liquid and rapidly plunge-freeze in liquid ethane.
