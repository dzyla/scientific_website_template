A guide for setting up automated data collection for cryo-EM.

1.  **Screen grids for ice thickness and particle distribution.**
    - Use a low magnification to find grid squares with good ice.
    - Check for an even distribution of particles.
2.  **Set up data collection software (e.g., EPU, SerialEM).**
    - Define grid atlas and select squares for data collection.
    - Set up hole/particle targeting parameters.
3.  **Define imaging conditions.**
    - Set magnification, defocus range, and exposure time.
4.  **Start automated data collection.**
    - Monitor the collection process for any issues.
