Our lab is honored to receive a new R01 grant from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to continue our research into structural virology. This funding will support our ongoing efforts to understand viral entry mechanisms and will fund the work of two new postdoctoral researchers. We are grateful for the NIH's support of our scientific vision.
