At our lab, we practice rigorous, data-driven science. We focus on clear questions and reproducible results.

* **Evidence first.** We base decisions on data, validated methods, and peer review. We comply with laws and ethics, and we let evidence guide conclusions.

* **Inclusive by design.** We welcome people of all identities and backgrounds. We judge ideas by their merit and treat everyone with respect.

* **Collaboration with purpose.** We work together when it creates real synergy. We share credit, help each other, and build on complementary strengths.

* **Curiosity leads the way.** We choose projects that ask exciting questions. Daily work can be hard, but the big question should energize you.

* **Smart productivity.**  We plan well, think deeply, and focus on high-value tasks. We measure progress by insight and results, not hours.

* **Open and direct communication.** We speak clearly, listen actively, and give timely feedback. We discuss results and concerns with respect and honesty.

* **Reproducibility and openness.** We document methods, keep clean code and data, and share materials when possible. We aim for work others can repeat.

* **Learning and mentorship.** We teach skills, review each otherâ€™s work, and celebrate growth. We expect questions, curiosity, and steady improvement.

* **Safety and integrity.** We follow safety rules, institutional policies, and community standards. We avoid shortcuts that risk people or data quality.
