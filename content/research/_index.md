# Our Research Focus

Our lab utilizes cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to study the structures of viruses and their components.  We focus on:

*   **High-Resolution Structure Determination:**  We employ advanced cryo-EM techniques to determine the structures of viruses and viral proteins at near-atomic resolution, revealing crucial details about their architecture.
*   **Dynamic Structural Analysis:** We investigate conformational changes and dynamics within viral structures, gaining insights into processes such as assembly, maturation, and host cell entry.
*   **Ligand Binding and Inhibition:** We study how potential antiviral compounds interact with viral targets, providing a foundation for structure-based drug discovery.
*   **Method Development:**  We contribute to the development of new cryo-EM methodologies and data analysis tools to push the boundaries of the field.

We are particularly interested in viruses with significant public health impact, including [list some virus families or specific viruses here]. Our research contributes to a deeper understanding of viral mechanisms and informs the development of novel therapeutic strategies.

## Our Projects

### Project 1:  Understanding Virus X Assembly

We are investigating the assembly mechanism of Virus X using cryo-EM. This project focuses on identifying key structural intermediates and understanding the roles of different viral proteins in the assembly process.

### Project 2: Developing Novel Inhibitors for Virus Y

This project aims to identify and characterize novel inhibitors that target Virus Y. We use cryo-EM to visualize inhibitor binding and understand the structural basis of inhibition, which can inform the development of antiviral therapeutics.
